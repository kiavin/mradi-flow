## üß¨ Warp Code Generator

Warp Code Generator reads API specifications or model definitions and auto-generates front-end views such as CRUD interfaces, detail views, and forms, accelerating UI development.


## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Warp parses a schema (e.g., OpenAPI, Swagger, or a model definition) and outputs ready-to-use Vue components tailored to your UI system (e.g., Tailwind, PrimeVue, Omniface).


### It uses:

    Predefined templates (table.vue, form.vue, etc.)

    Configurable fields, labels, validations

    Optional layout and wrapper components (Warp, OmniGridView, etc.)
